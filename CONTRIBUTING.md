# Contributing to EVOLUTIONARY ZERO

## Philosophy

EVO ZERO is built so you can break it. Not a doctrine. A model that invites falsification.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Falsify

Seven explicit falsification points live in the manifesto. Find an experiment that tests one. Describe the point you're testing, your experiment design, and results or plan.

### 2. Apply to a Domain

Take EVO ZERO into a specific domain: education, software, healthcare, business. Show where the model holds and where it breaks.

### 3. Critique Constructively

"Principle X fails because Y" beats "I don't like it." Data and examples beat opinions. Concrete counterexamples beat abstract objections.

### 4. Extend

What does the model miss? Propose an extension with an observation, a mechanism, and a falsifier.

## Format

- Issues: questions, critique, observations
- Pull Requests: domain applications, corrections, extensions
- Discussions: debates, ideas, shared experience

## What NOT to Do

- Don't turn this into a guru community
- Don't add rules without falsifiers
- Don't remove falsification points
