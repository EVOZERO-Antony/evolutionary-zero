# EVOLUTIONARY ZERO

### The Cognitive Paradigm for the AI Age

---

Generation costs nothing. Code, analytics, prototypes. Instant and free. The bottleneck shifted. Not "how to build it" but "what needs to exist, why, and for whom."

EVO ZERO is a cognitive model for working with AI without losing autonomy. System 0/1/2/3. Nine principles. A closed loop where every cycle compounds the next.

## What's Inside

- **The Collapse of Linearity** — why the old thinking model stopped working
- **The Bottleneck Shift** — from execution to intent specification
- **Cognitive Stack** — System 0/1/2/3 extending Kahneman's framework
- **Nine Principles** — from Möbius Learning to Environment Design
- **The Closed Loop** — a cycle where every rotation compounds
- **Falsifiability** — built so you can break it
