# EVOLUTIONARY ZERO MANIFESTO

### The Cognitive OS Above the Singularity

*A Cognitive Manifesto — The Operating System Above the Singularity.*
*Extending Kahneman's dual-process theory into a four-system architecture for human–AI collaboration.*

## The Short Version

Everyone's talking about augmenting domain expertise with AI. We're saying something different: the loop itself *is* the entry point. You don't study a domain then build — you enter it by building on day one. Grab anchor points, fill gaps on the fly, go deep only where it matters. What took years now takes days. Knowledge is a byproduct of action, not a prerequisite.

This isn't theory. Neurodivergent minds have been forced to live this way forever — navigating by anchors, patterns, and whole-field awareness because the linear path never fit them. We borrowed their survival architecture and turned it into a repeatable protocol. The promise isn't that everyone moves equally fast. The promise is that nobody has to wait ten thousand hours before they're allowed to start.

The linear floor just got flooded. Code, prototypes, analysis — near-zero cost, faster than any team. The singularity didn't arrive from above. It happened below — swallowing everything organized around expensive execution.

What nobody's mapping is what comes next: entropy. More outputs per second than any human can evaluate. Every wrong call amplified at machine speed. Without architecture, you don't rise through abstraction — you dissolve in optionality.

This is a manifesto for vertical movement. How to stay sovereign above the flood. We know how the stack works, and we wrote it down.

**What's inside:**

- **Four-System Stack** — Kahneman's two systems were right for 2011. Now there are four. System 3 = AI (infinite scale, zero understanding). System 0 = human meta-cognition — the pilot that decides when to trust gut, when to reason, when to delegate.
- **DHS Register Architecture** — x86 uses 8 registers to govern infinite memory. Your brain holds 4±1 chunks. Five cognitive registers — Intent, Constraints, Invariants, Anchors, Risks — pilot the AI swarm. Hardware logic applied to cognition.
- **Diffuse Hermeneutic Spiral** — boot registers → swarm generates → red team breaks → audit the loop → synthesize → tighten. Every cycle compounds. Without consolidation (ZLC), every spiral is just a circle.
- **Backward Singularity** — infinite execution forces radical simplicity at control. The register file is not dumber than RAM. It is sovereign over it.
- **Exoskeleton Test** — turn off the AI. Can you still think? Yes = exoskeleton. No = prosthetic.
- **Nine Principles** — closed operational loop from epistemic hygiene to environment design. Each principle advances all others.

**The neurodivergent connection:** pattern-first, anchor-based, diffuse navigation — the minds labelled "broken" were pre-adapted. They ran this operating system before the tools existed. Most founders, builders, and visionaries are wired this way. This manifesto makes their survival strategies legible — a protocol anyone can run.

## Who This Is For

Written for people already inside the blast radius — founders, engineers, neurodivergent builders whose industries are melting in real time. But the bottleneck won't stay confined to them. In a decade, human + AI will be the default configuration for everyone. The first pilots don't get to keep the map. Their job is to make it legible.

This is also a falsifiable framework with testable predictions and explicit kill conditions. See the Falsifiability section.

## Academic Context

Extends Kahneman's dual-process theory (2011) with System 0 (human meta-reasoning) and System 3 (AI). Inverts Chiriatti et al. (2025) who position "System 0" as an AI preprocessor — here it is exclusively human, governing AI from above. Same term, opposite architecture. The DHS register model applies Miller (1956) and Cowan (2001) working memory limits to human-AI cognitive orchestration. Möbius Learning formalizes the collapse of the learn/create boundary.

Built on: Kahneman (2011), Gadamer (1960), Shannon (1948), Miller (1956), Cowan (2001), Oakley (2014), Genewein (2015), Chiriatti et al. (2025).
